#### DATA SOURCE:

Reed D. 2019. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0. Dataset accessed 11/17/2019.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

You're about to dive into some deep data collected from five reef sites in Santa Barbara County, all about the abundance of California spiny lobsters!  Data was gathered by divers annually from 2012 to 2018 across Naples, Mohawk, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado reefs.

Why lobsters? Well, this sample provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established on January 1, 2012 (Reed, 2019). Of these five reefs, Naples, and Isla Vista are MPAs, while the other three are not protected (non-MPAs). Comparing lobster health between these protected and non-protected areas gives us the chance to study how commercial and recreational fishing might impact these ecosystems.

We will consider the MPA sites the `treatment` group and use regression methods to explore whether protecting these reefs really makes a difference compared to non-MPA sites (our control group). In this assignment, we’ll think deeply about which causal inference assumptions hold up under the research design and identify where they fall short. 

Let’s break it down step by step and see what the data reveals! 

![](figures/map-5reefs.png)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Anticipating potential sources of selection bias

**a.** Do the control sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) provide a strong counterfactual for our treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista)? Write a paragraph making a case for why this comparison is centris paribus or whether selection bias is likely (be 
specific!).  

The comparison between control and treatment sites in this case is not centris paribus. The designation of the Naples and Isla Vista reefs as MPAs inherently introduces selection bias because these were not randomly treated. In fact, these two MPAs were carefully established based on the input of local divers, people who fished in the area, and other stakeholders and reef-specific concerns. The main goal of these MPAs was to preserve threatened marine ecosystems and protect the endangered species that inhabit them. In short, these reefs were designated as MPAs because of their unique characteristics and sensitive habitats, not at random. Thus, differences in lobster abundance across control and treatment sites may be due to pre-existing ecological conditions that led to the creation of the MPAs in the first place, rather than an effect from the treatment. An unbiased comparison between control and treatment sites is not possible in this case. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Read & wrangle data

**a.** Read in the raw data. Name the data.frame (`df`) `rawdata`
```{r}
rawdata <- read_csv(here("data","spiny_abundance_sb_18.csv"),
                         na = "-99999")

sum(is.na(rawdata))
```

**b.** Use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

```{r}
# HINT: check for coding of missing values (`na = "-99999"`)

rawdata <- clean_names(rawdata)

```

**c.** Create a new `df` named `tidyata`. Using the variable `site` (reef location) create a new variable `reef` as a `factor` and add the following labels in the order listed (i.e., re-order the `levels`): 
    
    "Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"

```{r}

tidydata <- rawdata %>%
  mutate(reef = factor(site,
                       levels = c("AQUE","CARP","MOHK","IVEE","NAPL"),
                       labels = c("Arroyo Quemado","Carpinteria","Mohawk","Isla Vista","Naples")))
    
```

Create new `df` named `spiny_counts` 

**d.** Create a new variable `counts` to allow for an analysis of lobster counts where the unit-level of observation is the total number of observed lobsters per `site`, `year` and `transect`. 

- Create a variable `mean_size` from the variable `size_mm`
- NOTE: The variable `counts` should have values which are integers (whole numbers). 
- Make sure to account for missing cases (`na`)!

```{r}
spiny_counts <- tidydata %>%
  group_by(site,year,transect) %>%
  summarize(mean_size = mean(size_mm, 
                             na.rm = TRUE),
            counts = sum(count,
                         na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```


**e.** Create a new variable `mpa` with levels `MPA` and `non_MPA`. For our regression analysis create a numerical variable `treat` where MPA sites are coded `1` and non_MPA sites are coded `0`

```{r}
#HINT(d): Use `group_by()` & `summarize()` to provide the total number of lobsters observed at each site-year-transect row-observation. 

#HINT(e): Use `case_when()` to create the 3 new variable columns

spiny_counts <- spiny_counts %>%
  mutate(mpa = case_when(site %in% c("IVEE","NAPL") ~ "MPA",
                                       .default = "non_MPA")) %>%
  mutate(treat = case_when(mpa == "MPA" ~ 1,
                           .default = 0)) 

```

> NOTE: This step is crucial to the analysis. Check with a friend or come to TA/instructor office hours to make sure the counts are coded correctly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Explore & visualize data

**a.** Take a look at the data! Get familiar with the data in each `df` format (`tidydata`, `spiny_counts`)

```{r}
dim(tidydata)
dim(spiny_counts)

head(spiny_counts)
head(tidydata)

site_mean <- spiny_counts %>%
  group_by(mpa) %>%
  summarize(mean_counts = mean(counts)) %>%
  ungroup
```


**b.** We will focus on the variables `count`, `year`, `site`, and `treat`(`mpa`) to model lobster abundance. Create the following 4 plots using a different method each time from the 6 options provided. Add a layer (`geom`) to each of the plots including informative descriptive statistics (you choose; e.g., mean, median, SD, quartiles, range). Make sure each plot dimension is clearly labeled (e.g., axes, groups).

- [Density plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/density-plot-group-ggplot2)
- [Ridge plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/ggridges/)
- [Jitter plot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html) 
- [Violin plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/violin-plot-group-ggplot2) 
- [Histogram](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/) 
- [Beeswarm](https://r-charts.com/distribution/beeswarm/)

Create plots displaying the distribution of lobster **counts**:

```{r, eval=TRUE}

density_plot <- spiny_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = counts, fill = mpa)) +

        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "black")) 
  
 

  
print(density_plot)

               geom = "crossbar",
               fill = "white",
               size = 0.35,
               show.legend = TRUE) +  
  labs(title = "Lobster counts by year",
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Lobster count",
       color = "Mean counts") +  
  scale_fill_viridis_d(guide = "none") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c(" " = "black")) +  
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,300,25)) +
  coord_flip() +

  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "black"),
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "black",
                                  linewidth = 0.1),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black")) 

print(jitter_plot)



```

3) grouped by site
```{r}
violin_plot <- spiny_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = site, y = counts, 
             fill = site)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.9,
              width = 1.2) +  
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
        legend.text = element_text(color = "black"),
        legend.title = element_text(color = "black"),
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "black",
                                  linewidth = 0.1),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black")) +
  labs(title = "Lobster counts by reef site",
       fill = "Site",
       x = "Site", 
       y = "Lobster count") +
  stat_summary(
    aes(label = paste0("Mdn ","",round(..y.., 1))),
    size = 2,

  )) +

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,300,25)) +
  coord_flip() 
  

print(violin_plot)

```

Create a plot of lobster **size** :

4) You choose the grouping variable(s)!

```{r}

medians <- spiny_counts %>%
  group_by(site) %>%
  summarize(median_size = median(mean_size, na.rm = TRUE))

spiny_counts %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mean_size, y = site, fill = site)) +
  geom_density_ridges(
    alpha = 0.5,
    size = 1,
    scale = 2
  ) +
  geom_text(data = medians, 
            aes(x = median_size, 
                y = site, 
                label = paste0("Median"," ",(round(median_size, 2)))),
            color = "black", 
            size = 2, 
            vjust = -0.75) +
  theme(text = element_text(color = "white"),
        axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),
        legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "black",
                                  linewidth = 0.1),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black")) +
  labs(
    title = "Density of lobster mean size by reef site",
    x = "Lobster mean size", 
    y = "Reef site",
    fill = "Site"
  ) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "indianred2", "cornflowerblue", "gold1", "plum2", "seagreen2"
  )) 
    
```

**c.** Compare means of the outcome by treatment group. Using the `tbl_summary()` function from the package [`gt_summary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html) 

```{r}
spiny_counts %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  tbl_summary(.,
            by = "mpa",
            statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean}"),
            include = "site") 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: OLS regression- building intuition

**a.** Start with a simple OLS estimator of lobster counts regressed on treatment. Use the function `summ()` from the [`jtools`](https://jtools.jacob-long.com/) package to print the OLS output

```{r}
# NOTE: We will not evaluate/interpret model fit in this assignment (e.g., R-square)

m1_ols <- lm(counts ~ treat,
             data = spiny_counts) 

tbl_1 <- summ(model = m1_ols,
     model.fit = FALSE) 

print(tbl_1)

```
**b.** Interpret the intercept & predictor coefficients *in your own words*. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the regression results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

The intercept = 22.73 is what the lm model estimates the average lobster count will be when the treatment is not being applied (when the site is not an MPA site). The predictor coeffient = 5.36 tells us that when the treatment IS applied (the site is an MPA) the estimated average lobster count will increase from 22.73 by 5.36. The predictor tells us that sites that are MPAs have a positive effect on lobster counts (lobsters are more abundant), in average, since the model is estimating across all the observations.

**c.** Check the model assumptions using the `check_model` function from the `performance` package

**d.** Explain the results of the 4 diagnostic plots. Why are we getting this result?

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "qq" )
```
**QQ plot explanation**
The straight line represents a normal distribution and the model's residuals diverge significantly from it. There is a noticeable pattern in our residuals when the distribution of normal residuals should have no pattern/be randomly distributed. This tells us we are more than likely using the wrong model for our data and we are not capturing the effect of possible patterns in it.

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "normality")
```
**Normality of residuals density plot explanation**
Plot indicates a departure from normality and it allows us to see HOW our model predictions deviate from a normal distribution. Our data is likely skewed (not symmetrically distributed) and has a tail.

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "homogeneity")
```
**Homogeneity of variance plot explanation** 
This plot shows that the residuals of our fitted values do not display constant variance across all levels, this means that the model does not accurately capture the variability of all levels in our data. 

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "pp_check")
```
**Posterior predictive check explanation**
This plot tells us that the distribution of our model data predictions do not match those that were actually observed. It speaks to a poor model fit. The model does not seem to be accurately representing and replicating the complexity of the observed data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Fitting GLMs

**a.** Estimate a Poisson regression model using the `glm()` function
```{r}
m2_pois <- glm(counts ~ treat, 
                   data = spiny_counts,
                   family = poisson(link = "log")) 

exp(coef(m2_pois))

summary(m2_pois)
```

**b.** Interpret the predictor coefficient in your own words. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

The model estimates how the treatment affects the lobster count of any given site. Meaning, in a reef site that is not an MPA the lobster count is estimated to be aprox. 23. When the treatment is applied (when the reef site is an MPA), model estimates a multiplicative factor of approx. 1.24. This means the model predicts an increase in lobster count when the treatment is applied (when the reef is an MPA)

**c.** Explain the statistical concept of dispersion and overdispersion in the context of this model. 

Dispersion is the spread/distribution of variability around the mean. A poisson model makes the assumption that the mean and variance of the data are equal to each other. Overdispersion in this case would mean that the variability predicted by the model is greater than the mean of the data. This means that the model may not be a good fit - it may not account for all the variability occurring in the data. There may be other interactions at play across sites and lobster counts that are unaccounted for.

**d.** Compare results with previous model, explain change in the significance of the treatment effect

The previous model (OLS) gave us a 5.36 coefficient for the treatment varible, but its p-value was 0.30, which is not statistically significant. Unlike the OLS model, the glm model gave us (when exponentiated) the percent change for one unit increase in the predictor and its p-value was highly significant. The change in the significance of the treatment effect is a result of the original OLS model being a poor fit for our data since we have counts data and overdispersion is present. OLS makes the assumption that our residuals are normally distributed and our data non-discrete, which is not the case here. 

```{r}
#HINT1: Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR): Exponentiation of beta returns coefficient which is interpreted as the 'percent change' for a one unit increase in the predictor 

#HINT2: For the second glm() argument `family` use the following specification option `family = poisson(link = "log")`
#
m2_pois <- glm(counts ~ treat, 
                   data = spiny_counts,
                   family = poisson(link = "log")) 


```

**e.** Check the model assumptions. Explain results.

The posterior predictive check uses data simulated from the model and compares it to the actual observed data. The PPC plot shows a discrepancy between the simulated and the observed outcomes. What the model is predicting is not what is being observed, pointing to a poor model fit. 
The residual variance as predicted by the model also does not align with the observed, another sign that the model is not capturing the true mechanisms at work within the data. There is no homogeneity in the variance of the observed when compared to the predicted, indicating that model does not capture the differences in variance across our data, it assumes homogeneity. 

**f.** Conduct tests for over-dispersion & zero-inflation. Explain results.

```{r}
check_model(m2_pois)
```



```{r}
check_overdispersion(m2_pois)
```

**Overdispersion test explanation**
The test shows a dispersion ratio of 67.033. A dispersion > 1 is considered overdispersion. The p-value of our test is very small, certainly significant. This means that we can confidently say there is more variability in the data than the model can predict.

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m2_pois)
```

**Zero-inflation explanation**
The results of the test say that the model did not predict/account for ANY zeros being present in our data. However, our data did contain 27 observations that were = 0. This means that the model is underfitting our data and our data is inflated - it contains more zero values than the model accounts for.

**g.** Fit a negative binomial model using the function glm.nb() from the package `MASS` and check model diagnostics 

```{r}
m3_nb <- glm.nb(counts ~ treat,
                data = spiny_counts)

summary(m3_nb)
```

**h.** In 1-2 sentences explain rationale for fitting this GLM model.

A negative binomial model allows for overdispersion, whereas a regular glm poission model does not. Since we tested for dispersion and found a significantly large dispersion ratio, we need to fit a model that can accommodate for this overdispersion.

**i.** Interpret the treatment estimate result in your own words. Compare with results from the previous model.

```{r}

# NOTE: The `glm.nb()` function does not require a `family` argument

m3_nb <- glm.nb(counts ~ treat,
                data = spiny_counts)

summary(m3_nb)

```


```{r}
check_overdispersion(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_predictions(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_model(m3_nb)
```

**Comparison of m2_pois & m3_nb**

The coefficient (0.2118) for the treatment variable as predicted by the m3_nb model tells us the change in the log-count of the outcome (counts) for a one-unit increase in the treatment variable. Not only is this a small change in the outcome/ a small treatment effect, but the p-value for the treatment estimate is also not significant (0.218). This indicates, according to m3_nb, that the treatment does not appear to have a strong influence in lobster counts. 

The estimated coefficients of models m2_pois and m3_nb are very similar. However, m2_pois does not allow for zero-inflation and overdispersion. On the other hand, m3_nb tests did not detect overdispersion and the zero-inflation test detected not an underfitting, but rather a small OVERfitting of zeros. 

Despite these encouraging m3_nb results, the m3_nb coefficient p-values indicate that the model does not produce statistically significant estimates. Thus, even if the negative binomial model makes for a better fit, it does not allow us to confidently say that treatment has an effect on lobster count. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Compare models 

**a.** Use the `export_summ()` function from the `jtools` package to look at the three regression models you fit side-by-side.

**c.** Write a short paragraph comparing the results. Is the treatment effect `robust` or stable across the model specifications. 

```{r}

export_summs(m1_ols, m2_pois, m3_nb,
             model.names = c("OLS","Poisson", "NB"),
             statistics = "none")
```

**Comparing 3 models**
The estimated treatment effects are similar between m1_ols, m2_pois, and m3_nb - when exponentiated, both m3_nb and m2_pois estimate that the outcome will change by a factor of approx 1.236 (exp(0.2118)), or 23.6% (1.236 − 1 = 0.236). m1_ols has a treatment coeff of 5.36, but when transformed to % change, which is (5.36/22.73)*100 = 23.6%, we can clearly see that the estimated treatment effect is basically the same across the 3 models. 

Other than these similarities, the p-values of the estimated treatment effects vary across models. In the OLS model the treatment coefficient is not statistically significant. In the Poisson model the estimates are statistically significant but tests revealed both overdispersion and zero-inflation. Lastly, in the NB model tests showed no overdispersion and only a slight overestimation of zero-inflation, but the estimates were not statistically significant. When comparing the models, it is clear that while the predicted treatment effect may appear stable across models, it is not stable and not robust across different modeling approaches. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Building intuition - fixed effects

**a.** Create  new `df` with the `year` variable converted to a factor

**b.** Run the following negative binomial model using `glm.nb()`

- Add fixed effects for `year` (i.e., dummy coefficients)
- Include an interaction term between variables `treat` & `year` (`treat*year`)

**c.** Take a look at the regression output. Each coefficient provides a comparison or the difference in means for a specific sub-group in the data. Informally, describe the what the model has estimated at a conceptual level (NOTE: you do not have to interpret coefficients individually)

The model shows how the treatment effect is affected by the variable 'year', what the treatment effect was in the baseline year (2012). The interaction term in this case aims at estimating how the treatment effect changed over the years/how the difference in lobster counts between MPAs and non-MPAs changed over the years. In general, the model gives us a more complex and nuanced look at the mechanisms going on in the data. In the baseline year, 2012, MPAs had significantly fewer lobster than non-MPAs. This is also the year when these MPAs were established. And, since lobster counts go up over the years in these MPA sites, it shows that the treatment has had a positive effect on reef sites even if the lobster counts of these aren't dramatically higher than those of non-MPAs. 

**d.** Explain why the main effect for treatment is negative? *Does this result make sense?

This does make sense - the main effect for treatment is negative in the baseline year (2012). In 2012, the lobster count in now-MPA sites was lower because the benefits of the treatment were not yet tangible.

```{r}
ff_counts <- spiny_counts %>%
    mutate(year=as_factor(year))

m5_fixedeffs <- glm.nb(
    counts ~
        treat +
        year +
        treat*year,
    data = ff_counts)

summ(m5_fixedeffs, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**e.** Look at the model predictions: Use the `interact_plot()` function from package `interactions` to plot mean predictions by year and treatment status. 

**f.** Re-evaluate your responses (c) and (b) above. 

The interactions plot supports my responses in c and d above. 

```{r}

ff_counts$predicted_log <- predict(m5_fixedeffs, type = "link")
ff_counts$predicted_counts <- exp(ff_counts$predicted_log)

interact <- ggplot(ff_counts, aes(x = year, y = predicted_log, color = treat, group = mpa)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    labs(y = "Log of Counts", x = "Year") +
    theme_minimal()

interact
# HINT: Change `outcome.scale` to "response" to convert y-axis scale to counts
```

**g.** Using `ggplot()` create a plot in same style as the previous `interaction plot`, but displaying the original scale of the outcome variable (lobster counts). This type of plot is commonly used to show how the treatment effect changes across discrete time points (i.e., panel data). 

The plot should have... 
- `year` on the x-axis
- `counts` on the y-axis
- `mpa` as the grouping variable


```{r}
# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

plot_counts <- spiny_counts %>%
  group_by(year, mpa) %>%
  summarize(mean_count = mean(counts), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))  

plot_counts %>% ggplot(aes(x = year, 
                           y = mean_count, 
                           group = mpa, color = mpa)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +  
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Lobster counts over time by MPA status",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Mean lobster count",
    color = "MPA status"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 
```

Step 8: Reconsider causal identification assumptions

a. Discuss whether you think `spillover effects` are likely in this research context (see Glossary of terms; https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIudsVcYhWGpqC-Uftk9UTz3PIq6stVyEpT44EPNgpE/edit?usp=sharing)

Yes, spillover effects are relevant in this research context. Lobster can move without any limits between one MPA to another. When fishing pressures change (in both MPAs and non), lobster respond to these ecological and environmental changes in several ways - they may migrate due to increased competition amongst them, they may move toward other reefs due to temp changes, food availability etc. 

b. Explain why spillover is an issue for the identification of causal effects

The spillover effect is an issue for the identification of causal effects because blurs the differences between treated and non-treated reef sites. It complicates our ability to determine if the observed changes in lobster populations are a result of treatment or of unrelated/unintented lobster movement between reef sites. 

c. How does spillover relate to impact in this research setting?

Spillover can lead researchers to underestimate or overestimate the efficacy of the treatment, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the benefits of MPAs. Spillover can result in lobster counts being distorted by the movement of lobsters between MPAs and non-MPAs. For example, lower fishing pressure in MPAs could cause lobsters to migrate to non-MPA areas where competition is lower, potentially inflating counts in non-MPAs areas. Thus, spillover effects can distort the true impact of MPAs on lobster populations, leading to biased estimates of their effectiveness.

d. Discuss the following causal inference assumptions in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. Evaluate if each of the assumption are reasonable: 
    
    1) SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption 
    2) Excludability assumption
    
None of these assumptions are reasonable in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. The SUTVA is more than likely violated by the spillover effect since the changes in lobster count do not solely depend on the treatment effect.The lobster count of a non-treated site is affected by the treatment of another site. Furthermore, the treatment is not applied in the exact same way across all treated reefs (MPAs) as there are different levels of protection that an MPA can have. For example, some MPAs like the one in Isla Vista are designated as "no-take" areas, but not all MPAs have this protection nor do they all allow/prohibit the same activities. 

Lastly, the excludability assumption is violated because other than the spillover effect, there are countless other factors, human and and non-human-related, that affect the health of reefs and the abundance of lobster.
